# CYCLISTIC-BIKE-SHARE
# Business Task

The business task is to analyze the data from Cyclistic Bike Share and identify how annual members and casual riders use the bikes differently. The goal is to provide insights that can drive business decisions and improve the bike share program.

## The questions I would ask for this goal are:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

# Dataset

I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. The data has been made available by **Motivate International Inc.** under this [license](http://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). Datasets are available [here](http://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

This is public data that can be use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues is prohibited from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that we won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

# Prepare

After looking at the dataset, I decided to:

* Download data and store it appropriately: The data has been successfully downloaded and securely stored both on my local computer and within Kaggle's platform.

* Identify how it’s organized: The organization of the data is as follows: It's formatted as a comma-delimited (.CSV) file and consists of 13 columns namely "ride_id", "rideable_type", "started_at", "ended_at", "start_station_name", "start_station_id", "end_station_name", "end_station_id", "start_lat", "start_lng", "end_lat", "end_lng", and "member_casual".

* Sort and filter the data: In terms of filtering and sorting, the focus of the analysis will be on the most recent data from 2022 , as this provides the most pertinent and up-to-date insights for the task at hand.

* Determine the credibility of the data: Regarding the credibility and reliability of the data, it is suitable for this specific case study and will allow me to adequately address the business inquiries. However, due to data privacy constraints, personally identifiable information of the riders is not available, which prevents me from identifying if multiple rides were taken by the same user. Please note that all ride ids in this dataset are unique.

The dataset follows the ROCCC Analysis as described below:

* Reliable - Not biased
* Original - Can locate the original public data
* Comprehensive - Not missing important information
* Current - Updated monthly
* Cited
