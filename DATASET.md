I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. The data has been made available by **Motivate International Inc.** under this [license](http://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). Datasets are available [here](http://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

This is public data that can be use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues is prohibited from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that we won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
