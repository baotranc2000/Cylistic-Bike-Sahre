# CYCLISTIC-BIKE-SHARE
# Business Task

The business task is to analyze the data from Cyclistic Bike Share and identify how annual members and casual riders use the bikes differently. The goal is to provide insights that can drive business decisions and improve the bike share program.

## The questions I would ask for this goal are:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

# Dataset

I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. The data has been made available by **Motivate International Inc.** under this [license](http://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). Datasets are available [here](http://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

This is public data that can be use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues is prohibited from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that we won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
